                <h2>What Is Melanoma Skin Cancer?</h2>
                <p>
                    Melanoma is a cancer that begins in the melanocytes. Other names for this cancer include malignant 
                    melanoma and cutaneous melanoma. Most melanoma cells still make melanin, so melanoma tumors are usually 
                    brown or black. However, some melanomas do not produce melanin and can appear pink, tan, or even white.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Melanomas can develop anywhere on the skin, but they are more likely to start on the trunk (chest and 
                    back) in men and on the legs in women. The neck and face are other common sites. Although melanoma is 
                    less common than some other skin cancers, it is more dangerous because it is more likely to spread to 
                    other parts of the body if not detected and treated early.
                </p>
        
                <div id="additionalInfo" class="additional-info">
                    <p>
                        Early detection is crucial for effective treatment of melanoma. Regular skin checks, and awareness 
                        of changes in moles or skin lesions, such as size, color, or shape, can significantly improve 
                        outcomes. It's important to consult a dermatologist for any suspicious changes. The ABCDE rule 
                        (Asymmetry, Border, Color, Diameter, Evolving) can be a helpful tool in identifying early warning signs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Treatments for melanoma can vary based on the stage of the disease and may include surgery, 
                        immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or targeted therapies that focus on specific 
                        genetic mutations. Advancements in AI-driven diagnostic tools are also being explored to enhance 
                        early detection and personalized treatment approaches, further improving survival rates and 
                        patient care.
